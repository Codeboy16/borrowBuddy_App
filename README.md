# campusBuddy

As part of our BCA 3rd year project, we are creating a collaborative collage focused on addressing common challenges faced by students in their daily lives. Our goal is to provide practical solutions for issues such as:

Notes and Study Materials: Strategies for sharing and organizing notes effectively among classmates.
Previous Question Papers: A guide to accessing past exam papers for better preparation.
Finding Classrooms: Tips and tools to help students navigate the campus and locate their classrooms easily.
Affordable Food Options: A compilation of budget-friendly eateries and meal prep ideas that cater to student needs.
Through this collage, we aim to foster a sense of community and support among students, making their academic journey smoother and more enjoyable. Join us in finding creative solutions to everyday problems!
